## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

Create a homepage following the design. The page should be responsive. Fulfill user stories below:
- User story: I can see a page following the given design
- User story: On mobile, I can see a collapsed navigation
- User story: On mobile, when I select the hamburger menu, I can see a navigation

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Click Here to visit the website](https://intconsultantpage.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to make a responsive website using just CSS which turned out to be a really tough task. This is where I got the importance of using a framework where frameworks like bootstrap, tailwind make our life easier while designing responsive websites.

### Continued Development

Next up, I'll be learning new frameworks like bootstrap, tailwind and make some websites too! Also, need to practice making responsive websites with CSS only.
